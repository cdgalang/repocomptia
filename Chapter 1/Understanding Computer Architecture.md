# Understanding Computer Architecture
---
Computer Architecture refers to organization and design of a computer system, both hardware and software

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)

* The brain of the computer
* Executes instructions and performing calculations
* Contains **arithmethic logic unit** for mathematical operations and a **control unit** that manages the flow of data and instructions

### Memory

* **Random Access Memory (RAM)** stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to access
* **Cache Memory** are faster, smaller memory located near the CPU, storing frequently access data to improve performance

### System Bus

* Connects the CPU, memory, and other components
* Consists of **address bus**, **data bus**, and **control bus**
    * Address Bus: memory locations
    * Data Bus: transferring data
    * Control bus: coordinating operations between components
