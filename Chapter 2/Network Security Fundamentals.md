# Network Security Fundamentals
---

Definitions

* **Authentication**: process of verifying the identity of a user or device attempting to access a network
    * **Multifactor Authentication**: combines two or more of these methods to provide stronger security
* **Access Control**: determines what resources a user or device can access after authentication
* **Encryption**: protects the data and only authorized parties who has decryption key can access it. Common protocols includes TLS and IPsec
* **Firewalls**: filters traffic based on rules set by the user
* **Intrusion Detection Systems and Intrusion Prevention Systems**: monitor traffic for suspicious activity and potential attacks
* **Virtual Private Networks**: create secure, encrypted connections over public networks.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: systems collect and analyze security event data across the network
* **Network segmentation**: divides a network into separate segments or zones
* **Patch Management**: regular updates on software and systems
* **Security polocoes and procedures**: guidelines for secure network usage and operations
* **Security awareness training**: teaches users about security risks and best practices
* **Physical Security**: protects network infrastructure from physical access
* **Disaster recovery and business continuity planning**: restoration of network services after a security incident and disruption
* **Compliance Requirements**: specific security measures that organizations must implement
