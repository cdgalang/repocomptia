# Understanding Computer Architecture
---
Computer Architecture refers to organization and design of a computer system, both hardware and software

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)

* The brain of the computer
* Executes instructions and performing calculations
* Contains **arithmethic logic unit** for mathematical operations and a **control unit** that manages the flow of data and instructions
* **fetch decode execute cycle**: basic operational process of the CPU taht involves *fetching* an instruction, *decoding* it to determine the required operation and *executing* that operation.

### Memory

* **Random Access Memory (RAM)**: stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to access
* **Cache Memory** are faster, smaller memory located near the CPU, storing frequently access data to improve performance
* **Virtual Memory**: uses RAM and hard disk space to run programs and compensates for physical memory shortages by transferring data from RAM to disk storage

### System Bus

* Connects the CPU, memory, and other components
* Consists of **address bus**, **data bus**, and **control bus**
    * Address Bus: memory locations
    * Data Bus: transferring data
    * Control bus: coordinating operations between components

### Input/Output (I/O) Systems

* Think of it as connection for user to apply
* Examples such as keyboards, mouse, display and storage devices
* **instruction set architecture (ISA)** are set of instructions that a CPU can execute
* **Pipeline**: allows the CPU to begin executing a new instruction before the previous one has finished
