---

### Motherboard

* main circuit in a computer, where it serves as the central hub for connecting devices. It contains slots and ports for CPU, memory, storage devices and expansion cards. 

# Central Processing Unit (CPU)

* Brain of the computer
* Executes instructions, performs calculations, and manages data flow
* CPU performance include clock speed, number of cores and cache sieze

# Random Access Memory (RAM)

* provides temporary storage for data and instructions that the CPU need to access quickly
* RAM is volatile, it will lose its content when power is removed

# Storage devices

* Holds data permanently, even if the computer is turned off
* Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), Solid State Drives (SSDs)

# Power Supply Unit (PSU)

* converts AC power from wall outlet to DC power that components can use

# Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

* handles he rendering of images and videos

# Cooling Systems

* prevents overheating
* heat sinks, fans, liquid cooling
* Proper cooling is important for system stability and longetivity

# Input Devices

* Allow users to interact with computers
* Examples includes keyboards, mice, webcams
* Typically uses USBs or Bluetooth

# Output Devices

* present information to the user
* Examples includes monitors, speakers, headphones

# Network Interface Cards (NICs)

* enable communication with other devices on a network

# Expansion Cards

* add functionality to a computer system
* Includes sound cards, capture cards, and specialized cards

# Optical Drives

* reads and writes to CDs, DVDs, and Blueray Discs

# BIOS/UEFI chip

* contains firmware for booting process
* runtime services for OS and programs

# CMOS battery
 
* maintains system settings and the real time clock when computer is powered off
