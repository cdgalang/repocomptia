### Wi-Fi Standards Comparison

* Wi-Fi is based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards

| Standard  |Marketing Name | Frequency Band | Max Speed | Year | Additional Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 802.11b | - | 2.4 GHz | 11 Mbps | 1999 | earliest widely adopted standards, ideal for open spaces|
| 802.11a | - | 5 GHz | 54 Mbps | 1999 | ideal for office and closed environment |
| 802.11g | - | 2.4 GHz | 54 Mbps | 2003 | Improved on 802.11b |
| 802.11n | Wi-Fi 4 | 2.4 GHz, 5 Ghz | 600 Mbps | 2009 | Introduced MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) |
| 802.11ac | Wi-Fi 5 | 5 GHz | 3.5 Gbps | 2014 | - |
| 802.11ax | Wi-Fi 6 | 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz | 9.6 Gbps | 2019 | Latest standard, better performance in crowded networks |

**Bluetooth**
* used for short-range communications
* operates in the 2.4 GHz band
    * 1.0, 2.0: speed up to 2 Mbps
    * 3.0: increased to 24 Mbps
    * 4.0: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
    * 5.0: Quadrupled the range and doubled the speed comapre to 4.0; low energy usage
* commonly used in wireless headphones, keyboards, mice and other peripherals

**Cellular Networks** 
* 1G: analog voice calls
* 2G: digital voice and basic data services 
* 3G: mobile data internet with speeds up to 2 Mbps
* 4G LTE: speeds up to 100 Mbps, enables video streaming and other data intensive applications
* 5G: latest generation, speeds up to 20 Gpbs, extremely low latency

**NFC (Near Field Communication)**
* used for contactless payments
* 13.56 Mhz
* short range of a few centimeters

**RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)**
* uses electromagnetic fields to track and identify tags attached to objects
* used in inventory tracking, access control and payment systems

**LoRaWAN (Long Range WAN)**
* low-power, WAN protocol designed for IoT applications

**Zigbee**
* used in home automation and industrial settings
* operates in the 2.4, 915, and 868 MHz bands
* ability to form mesh networks

*Notes to consider*
* Several factors when implementing wireless networks
    * Security
    * Interference
    * Power Consumption
    * Latency
    * Range
    * Bandwidth
