# Network Topologies and Protocols
---

### Network Topologies

* physical and logical arrangement of devices in a network

---

[Topology](https://github.com/cdgalang/repocomptia/blob/main/Chapter%202/topology.jpg)

* Bus Topology
    * all devices are conencted to a single cable
    * received by all other devices
    * vulnerable, performance issues in larger networks

* Star Topology
    * most common topology
    * all devices are connected to a hub or switch
    * if central hub fails, entire network goes down

* Ring Topology:
    * all devices are in loop

* Mesh Topology
    * every device is directly connected
    * provides redundancy and fault tolerance
    * expensive and complex

* Tree Topology
    * combines star and bus topology
    * used in larger networks

* Hybrid Topology
    * combination of different topologies

### Protocols

* set of rules that govern how data is transmitted between devices on a network

---

* **Ethernet**
    * widely used protocol for LAN
    * defines the physical and data link layers of OSI model

* **Internet Protocol**
    * foundation of internet
    * addressing and routing packets
    * IPv4 and IPv6

* **Transmission Control Protocol**
    * works with IP to ensure reliable delivery of data
    * establishes connections, handles error checking and manages flow

* **User Datagram Protocol** 
    * connectionless
    * does not guarantee delivery or order of packets
    * faster than TCP
    * used in video streaming and gaming where speed is priority than reliability

* **Hypertext Transfer Protocol**
    * foundation of data communication on WWW
    * HTTPS is the secure version, that used encryption

* **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol**
    * sending email between servers

* **File Transfer Protocol**
    * transfer Files between client and server

* **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**
    * assigns IP addresses automatically

* **Domain Name Server**
    * Translates human readable names to IP addresses
