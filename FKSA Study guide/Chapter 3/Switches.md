- used to segment the networks into different subnets or LAN segments.
- Responsible for filtering and forwarding the packest between LAN segments based on MAC address.
 (Media Access Control)
Features of Switches

- performs error checking before forwaring data
- full duplex mode
- uses Unicast, multicast, and broadcast. 
- packet-switching used to transfer data packets from source to dest

### Layer 2 vs Layer 3 Switch

- Layer 2 works at Data Link layer
- uses MAC address to forward data
- Keeps traffic inside the same LAN
- Cannot route between different VLANs

- Layer 3 works at Network Layer
- can do everything a layer 2 switch does and includes routing
- IP address used
- can route traffic between different VLANs or subnets.
