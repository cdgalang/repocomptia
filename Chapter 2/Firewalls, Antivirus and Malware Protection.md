# Firewalls, Antivirus, and Malware Protection
---

### Firewalls

* Firewalls examine data packets travelling across networks
* Allow, Deny, or Block can be used based on firewall rules

* **Packet Filtering**: Filters packets based on IP address and ports and protocols and decide whether to allow or deny
* **Stateful Inspection Firewalls**: records information about active connections, and allow more informed decisions
* **Application-layer Firewalls**: AKA proxy firewalls. operate at the application layer where analyzes protocols at the application layer
* **Next-Generation firewalls**: combine traditional firewall capabilities with IDS, IPS, deep packet inspection and threat intelligence.
* **Host-Based Firewalls**: run on individual computers rather than network devices
* **Network-Based Firewalls**: protect entire networks and filter traffic network boundaries, providing centralized protection for all systems within the network

### Antivirus

* **AntiVirus software**: focuses on detecting, preventing and removing malicious software
* **Behavioral Monitoring**: looks for suspicious behavior in real time
* **Sandboxing**: runs malware in an isolated environment, purpose is to observe its behaviour
* **Machine Learning and AI**: identify patterns and characteristics of malware, improving on detection
* **Malware protection**: protection from viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, and more
* **Antimalware software**: tool that detects and removes specific types of threats
* **Endpoint protection platforms (EPPs)**: security for individual devices by combining antivirus, antimalware, personal firewall and other security features
* **Endpoint detection and response (EDR)**: solutions focus on detecting and investigating suspicious activities on endpoints
* **Web Filtering**: blocks access to malicious websites
* **Email Filtering**: scans incoming and outgoing emails for malware and other malicious threats.
* **Application whitelisting**: can allow and block applications
