### Network Topologies

* physical and logical arrangement of devices in a network

* Bus Topology
    * all devices are conencted to a single cable
    * received by all other devices
    * vulnerable, performance issues in larger networks

* Star Topology
    * most common topology
    * all devices are connected to a hub or switch
    * if central hub fails, entire network goes down

* Ring Topology:
    * all devices are in loop

* Mesh Topology
    * every device is directly connected
    * provides redundancy and fault tolerance
    * expensive and complex

* Tree Topology
    * combines star and bus topology
    * used in larger networks

* Hybrid Topology
    * combination of different topologies
